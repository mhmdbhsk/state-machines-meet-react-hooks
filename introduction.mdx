# What this talk is 😄

- A _very_ brief introduction to State Machines
- A small replica of my personal journey with:
  - State Machines, especially [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) in particular
  - [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- **How** to combine them together

# What this talk is _not_ 😅

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>An introduction to React Hooks</li>
    <li>A deep dig down of State Machines concepts</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Let's assume that everybody here is familiar enough with React Hooks
      <br />
      Shawn Wang will also talk about it later today
    </li>
    <li>
      State Machines concepts are <em>huge</em> and it won't fit in this 30
      minutes talk
    </li>
  </ul>
</Notes>

# Problem Statement

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Complex UI flows require multiple states</li>
    <li>Multiple states are generally too implicit</li>
    <li>Implicit codes are harder to reason about</li>
    <li>Hidden bugs everywhere due to "invisible states"</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# Hypothesis

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>State machines make all states are visible</li>
    <li>No invisible states means no hidden bugs</li>
  </Appear>
