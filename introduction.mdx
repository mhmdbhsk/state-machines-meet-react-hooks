# What this talk is 😄

- A _very_ brief introduction to State Machines
- A small replica of my personal journey with:
  - [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
  - State Machines, especially [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/) in particular
  - How to combine them together
- There will be **A LOT** of code, buckle up!

# What this talk is _not_ 😅

- An introduction to React Hooks
- A deep dig down of State Machines concepts

<Notes>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Let's assume that everybody here is familiar enough with React Hooks
      <br />
      Shawn Wang will also talk about it later today
    </li>
    <li>
      State Machines concepts are <em>huge</em> and it won't fit in this 30
      minutes talk
    </li>
  </ul>

# Problem Statement 🤯

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Complex UI flows require multiple states ⚛️</li>
    <li>Multiple states are generally too implicit 🧐</li>
    <li>Implicit codes are harder to reason about 🤔</li>
    <li>This causes hidden bugs everywhere due to "invisible states" 🕶</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# State Machines to the Rescue!

## 🦸‍♂️ 🦸‍♀️

# Hypothesis 🤔

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>State machines make all states are visible 👀</li>
    <li>No invisible states means no hidden bugs 🤞</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# Enough talk 🗣
