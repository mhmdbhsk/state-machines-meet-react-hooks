# Advantages 🤑

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Now all states are visible! 👀</li>
    <li>Easier to test 🧪</li>
    <li>All state transitions are well-tested 💯</li>
    <li>Is it bug free, as I hypothesized? ❓</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# Caution! ⚠️

<ul>
  <li>It's not completely bug free 😧</li>
  <Appear>
    <li>
      There are still some bugs coming from
      <br />
      discrepancies between the state & the rendered views
    </li>
    <li>We should have tested the rendered views as well</li>
    <li>Consider Integration Tests</li>
  </Appear>

# Lessons Learned 📝

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>State Machines must be designed thoroughly 🧐</li>
    <li>
      Yes, it's easier to test the states,
      <br />
      but don't forget to test the rendered views! ⚠️
    </li>
    <li>
      There's no silver bullet
      <br />
      Just as other solutions out there, e.g.

          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You might not need State Machines</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>You might not need ... (fill in yourself)</em>
